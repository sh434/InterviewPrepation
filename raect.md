# React.js and Node.js Interview Preparation

## React.js Interview Preparation

### Key Topics:

#### Components and Props:
- Functional vs Class Components
- Props and PropTypes
- State management within components

#### State Management:
- useState, useReducer
- Context API
- Redux (actions, reducers, store, middleware)

#### Lifecycle Methods (Class Components):
- componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount

#### Hooks:
- useState, useEffect, useContext
- Custom Hooks
- Rules of Hooks

#### Event Handling:
- Handling events in React
- Synthetic events

#### Routing:
- React Router (useHistory, useParams, Link, etc.)
- Nested routes

#### Form Handling:
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
- Validation and form libraries like Formik, React Hook Form

#### Performance Optimization:
- React.memo, useCallback, useMemo
- Lazy loading and code splitting

#### Error Boundaries:
- Error handling in React

#### Testing:
- Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Snapshot testing

### Common Interview Questions:
1. Explain the difference between functional and class components.
2. What are React Hooks, and why were they introduced?
3. How does the Context API differ from Redux for state management?
4. How do you optimize the performance of a React application?
5. Explain the purpose of `useEffect` hook with an example.
